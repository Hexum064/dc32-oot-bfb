Modes: Freeplay/standby and OOT song Mode
    -Also plays nyan when a combo of first and last note buttons are pushed at the same time
        -Continues to play until another note button or the mode button is pressed
        -Does not change the mode but will stop a song that is playing
Buttons: Touch buttons play 5 different notes
    -Plays the five notes from OOT
    -Playing another note while an OOT song is playing will stop the song and play the note
Mode Button: Switches between the two Modes
    -Easter egg when the mode button is held down: plays the motorola low battery chirp
        -does not change the mode but will stop a song that is playing
OOT Mode: Playing a combo of single notes will play a corresponding song if it exists
    -Error tone is played if the combo does not match anything
    -Song only plays once OR song repeats (to be decided)
Triforce LEDs: independent of mode 
    -PWMs the 3 LEDs with different sequences in a long repeating pattern
RGB LEDs:
    -In Freeplay/Standby mode, upper LEDs just show a repeating pattern
    -In OOT song mode, upper LEDs are off until a song is played or error tone is played
        -LEDs show in a chasing color gradient specific to the song and stop when the song stops
    -In either mode, lower LEDs glow with an individual color when the corresponding note button is being pressed
        -lower LEDs can follow upper when note is not being pressed
Puzzle? Maybe. TBD

MAYBE! Nayn mode is entered from sequence of notes played
